"     1A2B is a simple game to enjoy.\n     The computer will prepare a non-repeating four-digit nubmer (first digit could be 0). The player needs to find that very number.\n     The computer will provide hints according to the number inputted by the player. For example: \"1A2B\" means that there is one correct digit in its correct place while there are two correct digits in wrong places.\n     Try to guess the right number, compete with your friends, and enjoy!" = "       1A2B 是一个简单的益智游戏。\n       计算机会准备一组数字不重复的四位数，玩家必须猜出是哪一组四位数。\n       每当玩家输入四位数字，计算机会根据玩家的猜测提供提示，举例来说：1A2B，1A代表有一个数字正确、位置也正确，2B代表有两个数字正确、但是位置不正确。        依据计算机的提示，跟朋友比比谁能花最少次数猜出答案吧！";
